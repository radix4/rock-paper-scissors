# rock-paper-scissors

## Description
This is a simple rock-paper-scissor game where users play against the computer.
The UI has three buttons that users can click: Rock, Paper, & Scissors.
When any button is clicked, the computer generates a random hand.
The game then compares the two inputs and outputs the winner.
The game ends when either the users or the computer wins 5 times, the users can choose to play again or not.

## Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript

## Reflection
It was really fun manipulating the DOM with JavaScript methods: createElement, addEventListener, getElementById, textContent, etc.
